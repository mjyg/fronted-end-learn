        “Yes,” says the wolf, “I’m hungry because you are guarding the sheep. Now I am so weak that I can’t find food. I think I will do.”
        
        “Why not help me?” Asks the dog, “I work regularly and I eat regularly. You could do the same. You can help me guard the sleep. In that way, I will not worry about your stealing the sleep, and you will not worry about going hungry. It’s good for us.`,

        Just before he reached her, he felt one final urge to bet. He went back to the roulette table and put everything on No. 10, black. The wheel spun1 round and round, and finally stopped on No.12. red. Heartbroken, the fellow returned to his room.

        paragraph: `“I had another bad dream,“ she told her fiancé. “It was about you again. You and your ex-girlfriend were kissing. I yelled at you to stop it. You looked right at me, and then you laughed at me! She laughed, too. Then you both went back to kissing. I tried not to watch, but when I covered my eyes, something pulled my hands away. I tried to leave, but my feet were glued to the ground. Finally, I woke up. Of course, it was very difficult to get back to sleep.

        “I had to drive home from Las Vegas this morning. It's a wonder I didn't crash 50 times. Instead of seeing traffic in front of me, all I saw was you and her. I can't take any more dreams like this. We're going to have to break up. We can be friends, but just friends. That way, I won't be jealous anymore, and I won't have these bad dreams anymore.“
        
        “Why didn't you call me up and tell me about your dream?“ he asked. “They say that the more you talk about bad dreams, the sooner you'll stop having them.“`,

        title: 'A fisherman and a genie',
        paragraph: `Once upon a time there was an old fisherman. He went fishing very early every morning, but he never cast his net more than four times a day.
        One morning, he went out early to the sea. He cast his net for the first time, and drew in the body of an animal. He cast it a second time, and drew in an old basket full of sand. He cast it a third time, and drew in a lot of stones. It seemed he would have nothing to take home that morning.
        Day had now broken, and he cast his net for last time. After some time, he began to draw the net in. He found it was very heavy. But there were not any fish in it. Instead he found a jar with a lid. He shook the jar, but could hear nothing. So he took off the lid and looked inside. He could see nothing. After a while a light smoke came slowly out of the jar. Then little by little, the smoke grew heavier and thicker till finally it turned into a terrible Genie!
        “Get down on your knees,“ said the Genie, “for I'm going to kill you.“
        “Why? Didn't I set you free from the jar?“
        “That's why I'm going to kill you, but I'll let you choose how you're going to die.“
        “But why?“
        “Listen, and I will tell you my story.“
        “I was one of the spirits in heaven. But I did not want to obey Solomon's orders. So one day, he put me in this jar and threw it into the sea.
        “During the first hundred years of my stay in the sea, I made a promise that if anyone set me free I would make him very rich. But no one came. During the second hundred years, I promised that if anyone set me free I would show him all the treasures in the world. But still no one came. During the third hundred years, I promised that if anyone came to set me free, I would make him king over the earth.`,
